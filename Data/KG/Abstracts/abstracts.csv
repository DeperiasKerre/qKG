https://doi.org/10.1063/1.2189671,10.1063/1.2189671,"We report terahertz quantum-cascade lasers operating predominantly at 1.90 THz with side modes as low as 1.86 THz ( λ≈161 μm, ℏw=7.7 meV. This is the longest wavelength to date of any solid-state laser that operates without assistance of a magnetic field. Carriers are injected into the upper radiative state by using a single quantum-well injector, which resulted in a significant reduction of free-carrier losses. The laser operated up to a heat-sink temperature of 110 K in pulsed mode, 95 K in continuous wave (cw) mode, and the threshold current density at 5 K was ∼140 A/cm2."
https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.23.019689,10.1364/OE.23.019689,"A 2.1 THz quantum cascade laser (QCL) based on a scatteringassisted injection and resonant-phonon depopulation design scheme is demonstrated. The QCL is based on a four-well period implemented in the GaAs/Al0.15Ga0.85As material system. The QCL operates up to a heat-sink temperature of 144 K in pulsed-mode, which is considerably higher than that achieved for previously reported THz QCLs operating around the frequency of 2 THz. At 46 K, the threshold current-density was measured as ∼745 A/cm2 with a peak-power output of ∼10 mW. Electrically stable operation in a positive differential-resistance regime is achieved by a careful choice of design parameters. The results validate the robustness of scattering-assisted injection schemes for development of low-frequency (n < 2:5 THz) QCLs."
https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1554479,10.1063/1.1554479,"We report the development of a quantum cascade laser, at λ=87.2 mm, corresponding to 3.44 THz or 14.2 meV photon energy. The GaAs/Al0.15Ga0.85As laser structure utilizes longitudinal-optical (LO) phonon scattering for electron depopulation. Laser action is obtained in pulsed mode at temperatures up to 65 K, and at 50% duty cycle up to 29 K. Operating at 5 K in pulsed mode, the threshold current density is 840 A/cm2, and the peak power is approximately 2.5 mW. Based on the relatively high operating temperatures and duty cycles, we propose that direct LO-phonon-based depopulation is a robust method for achieving quantum cascade lasers at long-wavelength THz frequencies."
https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3114418,10.1063/1.3114418,"Resonant-phonon terahertz quantum-cascade lasers operating up to a heat-sink temperature of 186 K are demonstrated. This record temperature performance is achieved based on a diagonal design, with the objective to increase the upper-state lifetime and therefore the gain at elevated temperatures. The increased diagonality also lowers the operating current densities by limiting the flow of parasitic leakage current. Quantitatively, the diagonality is characterized by a radiative oscillator strength that is smaller by a factor of two from the least of any previously published designs. At the lasing frequency of 3.9 THz, 63 mW of peak optical power was measured at 5 K, and approximately 5 mW could still be detected at 180 K."
https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4862177,10.1063/1.4862177,"A Terahertz quantum cascade laser with a rather high injection coupling strength based on an indirectly pumped scheme is designed and experimentally implemented. To effectively suppress leakage current, the chosen quantum cascade module of the device is based on a five-well GaAs=Al0.25Ga0.75As structure. The device lases up to 151 K with a lasing frequency of 2.67 THz. This study shows that the effect of higher energy states in carrier transport and the long-range tunnel coupling between states that belong to non-neighbouring modules have to be considered in quantum design of structures with a narrow injector barrier. Moreover, the effect of interface roughness scattering between the lasing states on threshold current is crucial."
https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3702571,10.1063/1.3702571,"A lasing scheme for terahertz quantum cascade lasers, based on consecutive phonon-photon-phonon emissions per module, is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The charge transport of the proposed structure is modeled using a rate equation formalism. An optimization code based on a genetic algorithm was developed to find a four-well design in the GaAs/Al0.25Ga0.75As material system that maximizes the product of population inversion and oscillator strength at 150 K. The fabricated devices using Au double-metal waveguides show lasing at 3.2 THz up to 138 K. The electrical characteristics display no sign of differential resistance drop at lasing threshold, which, in conjunction with the low optical power of the device, suggest—thanks to the rate equation model—a slow depopulation rate of the lower lasing state, a hypothesis confirmed by non-equilibrium Green’s function calculations."
https://doi.org/10.1021/acsphotonics.8b01280,10.1021/acsphotonics.8b01280,"Terahertz quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) are excellent coherent light sources, but are still limited to an operating temperature below 200 K. To tackle this, we analyze the influence of the barrier height for the identical three-well terahertz QCL layer sequence by comparing different aluminum concentrations (x = 0.12–0.24) in the GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs material system, and then we present an optimized structure based on these findings. Electron injection and extraction mechanisms as well as LO-phonon depopulation processes play crucial roles in the efficient operation of these lasers and are investigated in this study. Experimental results of the barrier height study show the highest operating temperature of 186.5 K for the structure with 21% aluminum barriers, with a record kBTmax/ℏω value of 1.36 for a three-well active region design. An optimized heterostructure with 21% aluminum concentration and reduced cavity waveguide losses is designed and enables a record operating temperature of 196 K for a 3.8 THz QCL."
https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4983030,10.1063/1.4983030,"The dynamical tuning due to rear facet illumination of single-mode, terahertz (THz) quantum-cascade lasers (QCLs) which employ distributed feedback gratings are compared to the tuning of single-mode QCLs based on two-section cavities. The THz QCLs under investigation emit in the range of 3 to 4.7 THz. The tuning is achieved by illuminating the rear facet of the QCL with a fiber-coupled light source emitting at 777 nm. Tuning ranges of 5.0 and 11.9 GHz under continuous-wave and pulsed operation, respectively, are demonstrated for a single-mode, two-section cavity QCL emitting at about 3.1 THz, which exhibits a side-mode suppression ratio better than 25 dB."
https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0003318,10.1063/5.0003318,"In this paper, we report a post-polishing technique to achieve nearly complete surface planarization for the buried ridge regrowth processing of quantum cascade lasers. The planarized device geometry improves the thermal conduction and reliability and, most importantly, enhances the power and efficiency in continuous wave operation. With this technique, we demonstrate a high continuous wave wall-plug efficiency of an InP-based quantum cascade laser reaching ∼41% with an output power of ∼12Wfrom a single facet operating at liquid nitrogen temperature. At room temperature, the continuous wave output power exceeds the previous record, reaching ∼5.6 W."

Optical power of 62mW with a threshold current density of 285 A/cm2 is obtained at 10K from a 130-𝜇m-wide and 1.5-mm-long laser in cw operation. Maximum cw operation temperature is up to 60 K. In pulsed mode, peak optical power more than 100mW at 10K and 2.1mW at 85K are observed from a 230-𝜇m-wide and 2-mm-long device."
https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6641/abdd4b,10.1088/1361-6641/abdd4b,"We have investigated the emission frequency of terahertz (THz) quantum-cascade lasers (QCLs) as a function of the location on the wafer. The frequency varies due to an inhomogeneous growth rate across the wafer. For three wafers based on GaAs/AlAs heterostructures for lasers with target frequencies of 3.36 and 3.92 THz, we observed a blue shift of the emission frequency from the center to the edge of the wafer. This blue shift is attributed to a decrease of the period length of the QCLs, which can be determined with spectroscopic techniques. The location-dependent period length is used to calculate a position-dependent frequency of the gain maximum for the active region. The correlation of the calculated frequencies with the emission frequencies of lasers fabricated from different locations on the wafer allows us to establish an effective method for the fabrication of THz QCLs emitting at a particular target frequency."

Furthermore, we have developed a method for the fabrication of terahertz quantum cascade laser (THz QCL) with double metal waveguide via low-temperature In-Au wafer bonding followed by SI-GaAs substrate removal. ICP RIE in BCl3/Ar has been used to obtain laser ridges (widths 50-200 mkm) with vertical sidewalls. We investigate the dependence of the MH energy band structure on the electric field and thermal properties of terahertz quantum cascade lasers (THz QCL) under different operation conditions."
https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.26.009194,10.1364/OE.26.009194,"A dual lasing channel Terahertz Quantum Cascade laser (THz QCL) based on GaAs/Al0.17Ga0.83As material system is demonstrated. The device shows the lowest reported threshold current density (550A/cm2 at 50K) of GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs material system based scattering-assisted (SA) structures and operates up to a maximum lasing temperature of 144K. Dual lasing channel operation is investigated theoretically and experimentally. The combination of low frequency emission, dual lasing channel operation, low lasing threshold current density and high temperature performance make such devices ideal candidates for low frequency applications, and initiates the design strategy for achieving high-temperature performance terahertz quantum cascade laser with wide frequency coverage at low frequency."
https://doi.org/10.1021/acsphotonics.6b00750,10.1021/acsphotonics.6b00750,"We report on the operation of a double metal waveguide far-infrared quantum cascade laser emitting at 28 μm, corresponding to the AlAs-like phonon reststrahlen band. To avoid absorption by AlAs-like optical phonons, the Al-free group V alloy GaAs0.51Sb0.49 is used as a barrier layer in the bound-to continuum- based active region. Lasing occurs at a wavelength of 28.3 μm, which is the longest wavelength among the quantum cascade lasers operating from mid-infrared to far-infrared. The threshold current density at 50 K is 5.5 kA/cm2, and maximum operation temperature is 175 K. We also discuss the feasibility that the operation wavelength can cover the whole spectral range bridging between mid-infrared and terahertz by choosing properly suited group III−V materials."
https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0198236,10.1063/5.0198236,"A band design of a quantum cascade laser with a generation frequency higher than 6 THz and an active region based on four GaAs/Al0.14Ga0.86As quantum wells is proposed. Calculations were carried out based on the solution of the Schrödinger equation taking into account the dephasing of quantum states, as well as a closed system of balance equations. The temperature dependences of the gain at frequencies of 6.3–6.6 THz were calculated for the proposed quantum cascade laser with a double metal waveguide. Features of the proposed laser structure include two injection quantum wells and the suppression of non-radiative transitions between laser levels. According to calculations, this provides the maximum operating temperature of up to 81 K at 6.4 THz. The results of this study open up the way for quantum cascade lasers based on GaAs/AlGaAs to operate at frequencies above 6 THz."

A large current density dynamic range is observed, leading to a maximum operation temperature of 150 Kfor the double metal waveguide device and a high peak output power more than 200mWfor the single surface plasmon waveguide device. Acontinuous wave, single mode, third order distributed feedback laser with a low electrical power dissipation and a narrow far-field beam pattern, which is required for a local oscillator in astronomy heterodyne spectrometers, is also demonstrated."

This result is achieved by using the alternative material combination In0.53Ga0.47As/GaAs0.51Sb0.49, lattice-matched to InP, which exhibits fabrication advantages over standard In0.53Ga0.47As/In0.52Al0.48As due to more suitable material parameters. An active region, based on a three-well phonon depletion design, with improved injection and extraction tunneling coupling, was designed. The devices exhibit threshold current densities of 0.75 kA/cm2 and provide peak optical powers up to 9mW. A broad spectral emission range between 3.3 and 4 THz is measured."
