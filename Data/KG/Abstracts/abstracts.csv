This is the longest wavelength to date of any solid-state laser that operates without assistance of a magnetic field. Carriers are injected into the upper radiative state by using a single quantum-well injector, which resulted in a significant reduction of free-carrier losses. The laser operated up to a heat-sink temperature of 110 K in pulsed mode, 95 K in continuous wave (cw) mode, and the threshold current density at 5 K was ∼140 A/cm2."

The QCL is based on a four-well period implemented in the GaAs/Al0.15Ga0.85As material system. The QCL operates up to a heat-sink temperature of 144 K in pulsed-mode, which is considerably higher than that achieved for previously reported THz QCLs operating around the frequency of 2 THz. At 46 K, the threshold current-density was measured as ∼745 A/cm2 with a peak-power output of ∼10 mW. Electrically stable operation in a positive differential-resistance regime is achieved by a careful choice of design parameters. The results validate the robustness of scattering-assisted injection schemes for development of low-frequency (n < 2:5 THz) QCLs."

The GaAs/Al0.15Ga0.85As laser structure utilizes longitudinal-optical (LO) phonon scattering for electron depopulation. Laser action is obtained in pulsed mode at temperatures up to 65 K, and at 50% duty cycle up to 29 K. Operating at 5 K in pulsed mode, the threshold current density is 840 A/cm2, and the peak power is approximately 2.5 mW. Based on the relatively high operating temperatures and duty cycles, we propose that direct LO-phonon-based depopulation is a robust method for achieving quantum cascade lasers at long-wavelength THz frequencies."

This record temperature performance is achieved based on a diagonal design, with the objective to increase the upper-state lifetime and therefore the gain at elevated temperatures. The increased diagonality also lowers the operating current densities by limiting the flow of parasitic leakage current. Quantitatively, the diagonality is characterized by a radiative oscillator strength that is smaller by a factor of two from the least of any previously published designs. At the lasing frequency of 3.9 THz, 63 mW of peak optical power was measured at 5 K, and approximately 5 mW could still be detected at 180 K."

To effectively suppress leakage current, the chosen quantum cascade module of the device is based on a five-well GaAs=Al0.25Ga0.75As structure. The device lases up to 151 K with a lasing frequency of 2.67 THz. This study shows that the effect of higher energy states in carrier transport and the long-range tunnel coupling between states that belong to non-neighbouring modules have to be considered in quantum design of structures with a narrow injector barrier. Moreover, the effect of interface roughness scattering between the lasing states on threshold current is crucial."

The charge transport of the proposed structure is modeled using a rate equation formalism. An optimization code based on a genetic algorithm was developed to find a four-well design in the GaAs/Al0.25Ga0.75As material system that maximizes the product of population inversion and oscillator strength at 150 K. The fabricated devices using Au double-metal waveguides show lasing at 3.2 THz up to 138 K. The electrical characteristics display no sign of differential resistance drop at lasing threshold, which, in conjunction with the low optical power of the device, suggest—thanks to the rate equation model—a slow depopulation rate of the lower lasing state, a hypothesis confirmed by non-equilibrium Green’s function calculations."

The frequency varies due to an inhomogeneous growth rate across the wafer. For three wafers based on GaAs/AlAs heterostructures for lasers with target frequencies of 3.36 and 3.92 THz, we observed a blue shift of the emission frequency from the center to the edge of the wafer. This blue shift is attributed to a decrease of the period length of the QCLs, which can be determined with spectroscopic techniques. The location-dependent period length is used to calculate a position-dependent frequency of the gain maximum for the active region. The correlation of the calculated frequencies with the emission frequencies of lasers fabricated from different locations on the wafer allows us to establish an effective method for the fabrication of THz QCLs emitting at a particular target frequency."

First, the depopulation of the lower radiative level is achieved through resonant longitudinal optical (LO-)phonon scattering. This depopulation mechanism is robust at high temperatures and high injection levels. In contrast to infrared QCLs that also use LO-phonon scattering for depopulation, in our THz lasers the selectivity of the depopulation scattering is achieved through a combination of resonant tunnelling and LO-phonon scattering, hence the term resonant phonon. This resonant-phonon scheme allows a highly selective depopulation of the lower radiative level with a sub-picosecond lifetime, while maintaining a relatively long upper level lifetime (>5 ps) that is due to upper-to-ground-state scattering. The second feature of our lasers is that mode confinement is achieved by using a novel double-sided metal–metal waveguide, which yields an essentially unity mode confinement factor and therefore a low total cavity loss at THz frequencies. Based on these two unique features, we have achieved some record performance, including, but not limited to, the highest pulsed operating temperature of 137 K, the highest continuous-wave operating temperature of 97 K, and the longest wavelength of 141 μm (corresponding to 2.1 THz) without the assistance of a magnetic field."

The optimum oscillator strength of 0.58 was found to be larger than that of the previous record (0.41) by Kumar et al. [Appl. Phys. Lett. 94, 131105 (2009)]. The choice of tunneling barrier thicknesses was determined with a simplified density matrix model, which converged towards higher tunneling coupling strengths than previously explored and nearly perfect alignment of the states across the injection and extraction barriers at the design electric field. At 8 K, the device showed a threshold current density of 1 kA/cm2, with a peak output power of ∼ 38 mW, and lasing frequency blue-shifting from 2.6 THz to 2.85 THz with increasing bias. The wavelength blue-shifted to 3.22 THz closer to the maximum operating temperature of 199.5 K, which corresponds to ∼ 1.28ħω/κB. The voltage dependence of laser frequency is related to the Stark effect of two intersubband transitions and is compared with the simulated gain spectra obtained by a Monte Carlo approach."

Peak optical powers of 100 mW at 4 K and power conversion-efficiencies as high as nw=(5.5±0.4%)  in continuous wave at 40 K were measured. The nw values were assessed via an experimental method based on the analysis of the local lattice temperature as extracted by microprobe photoluminescence versus electrical power. From the measured nw values they extracted a slope efficiency value 0.41±0.11 W/A.

This scheme is intended to improve high temperature operation by reducing thermal backfilling of the lower radiative state. The better of these two devices displays a threshold current density of 170 A/cm2 at 5 K and lases up to 138 K in pulsed mode and 105 K in continuous-wave mode. However, contrary to expectation, we observed no improvement in temperature performance compared to single-resonant-phonon designs, which suggests that the thermal backfilling is not yet a limiting factor for high temperature terahertz QCL operation."

Due to their compactness and high power, Quantum Cascade Lasers (QCLs) are one of the most important laser sources in this region. The selection rule of intersubband transitions
forces the radiation to be TM polarized and thus generated in-plane, consequently photonic structures have to be developed to extract the light vertically. Few approaches for surface emitting QCLs demonstrated the lasing of a second-order Bragg metallic grating patterned on top of a ridge [1] or a surface emitting photonic crystal (PhC) [2]. PhC band-edge lasers with improved performance compared to Fabry-Perot lasers have already been reported [3]. In this work a surface emitting band edge 2D PhC QCL is presented, using a second-order Bragg grating as a boundary condition.

The energy state difference between additional state and the upper laser state is equal to the longitudinal optical phonon energy which has a large magnitude (∼90 meV). The simulation results show that the proposed THz QCL can get better optical properties compared with the traditional three-level active region building in the same material system and has the superiority in improving electronic utilization.

As a result of the two-well injector direct-phonon scheme presented here, the lasers benefit from both a direct phonon scattering scheme for the lower laser level depopulation and a setback for the doping profile that reduces the overlap of the doped region with active laser states. Additionally, our design also has efficient isolation of the active laser levels from excited and continuum states as indicated by negative differential resistance behavior all the way up to room temperature.
