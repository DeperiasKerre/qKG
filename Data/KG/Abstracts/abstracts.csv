This is the longest wavelength to date of any solid-state laser that operates without assistance of a magnetic field. Carriers are injected into the upper radiative state by using a single quantum-well injector, which resulted in a significant reduction of free-carrier losses. The laser operated up to a heat-sink temperature of 110 K in pulsed mode, 95 K in continuous wave (cw) mode, and the threshold current density at 5 K was ∼140 A/cm2."
https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.23.019689,10.1364/OE.23.019689,"A 2.1 THz quantum cascade laser (QCL) based on a scatteringassisted injection and resonant-phonon depopulation design scheme is demonstrated. The QCL is based on a four-well period implemented in the GaAs/Al0.15Ga0.85As material system. The QCL operates up to a heat-sink temperature of 144 K in pulsed-mode, which is considerably higher than that achieved for previously reported THz QCLs operating around the frequency of 2 THz. At 46 K, the threshold current-density was measured as ∼745 A/cm2 with a peak-power output of ∼10 mW. Electrically stable operation in a positive differential-resistance regime is achieved by a careful choice of design parameters. The results validate the robustness of scattering-assisted injection schemes for development of low-frequency (n < 2:5 THz) QCLs."
https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1554479,10.1063/1.1554479,"We report the development of a quantum cascade laser, at λ=87.2 mm, corresponding to 3.44 THz or 14.2 meV photon energy. The GaAs/Al0.15Ga0.85As laser structure utilizes longitudinal-optical (LO) phonon scattering for electron depopulation. Laser action is obtained in pulsed mode at temperatures up to 65 K, and at 50% duty cycle up to 29 K. Operating at 5 K in pulsed mode, the threshold current density is 840 A/cm2, and the peak power is approximately 2.5 mW. Based on the relatively high operating temperatures and duty cycles, we propose that direct LO-phonon-based depopulation is a robust method for achieving quantum cascade lasers at long-wavelength THz frequencies."

This record temperature performance is achieved based on a diagonal design, with the objective to increase the upper-state lifetime and therefore the gain at elevated temperatures. The increased diagonality also lowers the operating current densities by limiting the flow of parasitic leakage current. Quantitatively, the diagonality is characterized by a radiative oscillator strength that is smaller by a factor of two from the least of any previously published designs. At the lasing frequency of 3.9 THz, 63 mW of peak optical power was measured at 5 K, and approximately 5 mW could still be detected at 180 K."

To effectively suppress leakage current, the chosen quantum cascade module of the device is based on a five-well GaAs=Al0.25Ga0.75As structure. The device lases up to 151 K with a lasing frequency of 2.67 THz. This study shows that the effect of higher energy states in carrier transport and the long-range tunnel coupling between states that belong to non-neighbouring modules have to be considered in quantum design of structures with a narrow injector barrier. Moreover, the effect of interface roughness scattering between the lasing states on threshold current is crucial."

The charge transport of the proposed structure is modeled using a rate equation formalism. An optimization code based on a genetic algorithm was developed to find a four-well design in the GaAs/Al0.25Ga0.75As material system that maximizes the product of population inversion and oscillator strength at 150 K. The fabricated devices using Au double-metal waveguides show lasing at 3.2 THz up to 138 K. The electrical characteristics display no sign of differential resistance drop at lasing threshold, which, in conjunction with the low optical power of the device, suggest—thanks to the rate equation model—a slow depopulation rate of the lower lasing state, a hypothesis confirmed by non-equilibrium Green’s function calculations."

To tackle this, we analyze the influence of the barrier height for the identical three-well terahertz QCL layer sequence by comparing different aluminum concentrations (x = 0.12–0.24) in the GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs material system, and then we present an optimized structure based on these findings. Electron injection and extraction mechanisms as well as LO-phonon depopulation processes play crucial roles in the efficient operation of these lasers and are investigated in this study.

The planarized device geometry improves the thermal conduction and reliability and, most importantly, enhances the power and efficiency in continuous wave operation. With this technique, we demonstrate a high continuous wave wall-plug efficiency of an InP-based quantum cascade laser reaching ∼41% with an output power of ∼12Wfrom a single facet operating at liquid nitrogen temperature.

The frequency varies due to an inhomogeneous growth rate across the wafer. For three wafers based on GaAs/AlAs heterostructures for lasers with target frequencies of 3.36 and 3.92 THz, we observed a blue shift of the emission frequency from the center to the edge of the wafer. This blue shift is attributed to a decrease of the period length of the QCLs, which can be determined with spectroscopic techniques. The location-dependent period length is used to calculate a position-dependent frequency of the gain maximum for the active region. The correlation of the calculated frequencies with the emission frequencies of lasers fabricated from different locations on the wafer allows us to establish an effective method for the fabrication of THz QCLs emitting at a particular target frequency."

First, the depopulation of the lower radiative level is achieved through resonant longitudinal optical (LO-)phonon scattering. This depopulation mechanism is robust at high temperatures and high injection levels. In contrast to infrared QCLs that also
use LO-phonon scattering for depopulation, in our THz lasers the selectivity of the depopulation scattering is achieved through a combination of resonant tunnelling and LO-phonon scattering, hence the term resonant phonon. This resonant-phonon scheme allows a highly selective depopulation of the lower radiative level with a sub-picosecond lifetime, while maintaining a relatively long upper level lifetime (>5 ps) that is due to upper-to-ground-state scattering. The second feature of our lasers is that mode confinement is achieved by using a novel double-sided metal–metal waveguide, which yields an essentially unity mode confinement factor and therefore a low total cavity loss at THz frequencies. Based on these two unique features, we have
achieved some record performance, including, but not limited to, the highest pulsed operating temperature of 137 K, the highest continuous-wave operating temperature of 97 K, and the longest wavelength of 141 μm (corresponding to 2.1 THz) without the assistance of a magnetic field."

over time, achieving some of the lowest threshold and peak current-densities among published terahertz QCLs with maximum operating temperatures above 100 K.
