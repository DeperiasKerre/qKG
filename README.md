## Semantic Enrichment of QCL properties from Text
* The repository contains the materials (source code and data) for the work proposed in the paper "Semantic Enrichment of the Quantum Cascade Laser Properties in Text- A  Knowledge Graph Generation Approach". 
* In this work, we propopose a methodology for an automatic generation of a knowledge graph (KG) for the QCL semiconductor laser properties from scientific literature based on a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) enabled LLM and the QCL ontology.
* The approach entails automatic extraction of QCL prpoerties of interest form scientific literature based on a RAG-powered LLM  and population of the KG Schema with the extracted properties to generate the KG.

## KG Data Files and the SPARQL Queries
* The KG data files in RDF/XML and Turtle Formats can be accessed [here](https://github.com/DeperiasKerre/qKG/tree/main/qcl_KG).
* The SPARQL queries and there results can be found [here](https://github.com/DeperiasKerre/qKG/tree/main/Results/KG).
